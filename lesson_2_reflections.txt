Q1 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A1 - When i initialize a repository, i had an alert message that tells me that i initialized
     an empty Git repository.
     I needed to initialize the repository to make it become a Git repository.

Q2 - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

     during the process of making commits.
